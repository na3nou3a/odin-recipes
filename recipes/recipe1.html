          <h2>Directions</h2>
          <h4>step 1</h4>
          <p class="step">
            To make the spicy red sauce, heat the olive oil in a large saucepan
            over medium heat, and cook and stir 1/2 cup of onion until the onion
            is softened, 3 to 4 minutes. Stir in 4 teaspoons of garlic, and cook
            and stir until fragrant, another 3 to 5 minutes, watching carefully
            to avoid burning the garlic. Stir in the oregano, 3 1/2 teaspoons of
            chili powder, basil, salt and black pepper, 1 teaspoon of cumin, the
            dried cilantro, salsa, tomato sauce, tomato paste, and chicken broth
            until the sauce is smoothly combined.
          </p>
          <h4>step 2</h4>
          <p class="step">
            Bring the sauce to a simmer, reduce heat to low, and simmer about 30
            minutes, stirring often, until the flavors have blended and the
            sauce has thickened slightly.
          </p>
          <h4>step 3</h4>
          <p class="step">
            While spicy red sauce is simmering, cook and stir the ground beef in
            a large skillet over medium-high heat until the meat is evenly
            browned. Break the meat up into crumbles as it cooks, and drain off
            excess grease. Mix in 3/4 cup of onion, 1 tablespoon of garlic, 1/2
            teaspoon of chili powder, and 1/2 teaspoon of cumin into the meat,
            and cook and stir until the onions are softened and the meat mixture
            is fragrant with spices, 5 to 10 more minutes. Stir in the enchilada
            sauce and beef broth; simmer for 5 more minutes. Stir in 1/2 cup of
            Mexican cheese blend, and allow the cheese to melt into the meat
            sauce. Reduce heat to low, and simmer the meat sauce for 30 more
            minutes to thicken.
          </p>
          <h4>step 4</h4>
          <p class="step">
            Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a 9x13-inch
            baking dish with cooking spray.
          </p>
          <h4>step 5</h4>
          <p class="step">
            Spray both sides of each tortilla with cooking spray, stack up the
            tortillas with a piece of aluminum foil between each tortilla, and
            wrap the stack with aluminum foil. Place the tortillas into the
            preheated oven to warm, about 10 minutes.
          </p>
          <h4>step 6</h4>
          <p class="step">
            Spread about 1/2 cup of the spicy red sauce over the bottom of the
            prepared baking dish. Fill each tortilla with the meat sauce,
            reserving about 1/2 cup of the meat sauce; roll the tortillas into
            enchiladas, and arrange in the baking dish, seam sides down. Pour
            the remaining spicy red sauce over the enchiladas. Sprinkle with the
            reserved 1/2 cup of meat mixture, and top with remaining 2 cups of
            Mexican cheese blend.
          </p>
          <h4>step 7</h4>
          <p class="step">
            Bake until the cheese topping is golden brown and the sauce is
            bubbly, about 30 minutes. Remove from oven and sprinkle with
            cilantro to serve.
